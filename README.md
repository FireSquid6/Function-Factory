# Function Factory
Function Factory is a math-based puzzle game where the player links up various objects to complete circuits. It's a hard game to explain with words, so look at the gif above.  
  
On the pink line, we simply have a dispenser spitting out a "5" block that's sent into the center. On the green line we have a dispenser with a 3 and another line that gives a 6 from off screen. These numbers are combined by an addition operator, which gives a 9 block that goes into the center. On the two blue lines, we have two 2 blocks. One gets evaluated by a > 1 block, and gets through, and the other gets evaluated by a < 1 block and gets stuck.

If you wanna learn more about the game, feel free to dive into the game's source code (pretty buggy rn) or read the files in the docs folder.
