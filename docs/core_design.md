# CORE DESIGN
Function factory is a math-based puzzle game where players build up programs to manipulate moving number blocks and output a specified result. This is done by placing "rails" for the number blocks to move on, and having them go through "operators" and "evaluators" to manipulate them (See game_entities.md). 

The player's core loop should be (as a Minimum Viable Product):
  - Experiment different solutions to problem
    - Each puzzle should provide different mechanics that require the player to toy with before understanding
    - No mechanic should be too obtuse nor too obvious
  - Discover the correct solution
    - The player should eventually have a "eureka" moment after exploring a specific puzzle
    - This feeling is the core appeal of the game
  - Master and optimize the puzzle
    - This will give the player an opportunity to compete on global leaderboards against their friends on their program's speed, efficiency, and cost
  - Move onto the next puzzle and repeat the loop
  
The player should also have the ability to design their own puzzles and share them with others through the steam workshop and direct exportation.

Core Feelings:
 - Eureka - the "ah ha!" moment once you figure out a puzzle
 - Fiero - positive feedback after performing a skilled task well
 - Curiosity - interest in pursuing the next puzzle
